AngularJS Exam
==============

Dear developer, the goal of this exam is to know a little more about your programming skills. Here at Edools we value too much excellence, a code with good quality makes us work better and happier :), and increase our ability to deliver customer value with speed and consistency. With this in mind, we want to know how you think the code, and how is your relationship with it.

The task is simple: play with our API. You will have to develop an application using AngularJS that will consume the course content's resource from our API, and present in a simple way but well-structured. The ideal flow of your app would be:

- user selects which course he wants to consume
- user is presented with a content tree

For this, first you'll have to create the objects in order to display them. You'll have to work with the `Course`, `CourseModule`, `CourseContent` models. To get some insight about how these models work, take a look at ou [API documentation](http://edools.github.io/core/).

To get started, just fork this repository, implement and then make a pull request, listing the features in the README that you have developed and how to run it.

It is very important that you show us your knowledge regarding good programming practices, **testing**, patterns and even the bad practices. Therefore, take these points into consideration when choosing and implementing your features.

Besides this, there are some things that will be a big plus if you play with:

- usage of ES6
- a tool to help with your workflows like Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Webpack...
- a CSS pre-processor of your choice

And if you feel really inspired, tell us how did you make your decisions regarding the choice of your tools.
We wish you good luck, and may the Quality be with you!
